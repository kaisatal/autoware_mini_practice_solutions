pure_pursuit_follower.py:

Added a state for when the car needs to be stopped (boolean self.needs_to_stop).
- The state is entered when an empty path is received (and "Goal reached, path cleared." is logged only once).
- In this state, the car's linear velocity is always 0.
- The state is exited when the car has been still for 2 frames.


lanelet2_global_planner.py:

In convert_lanelets_to_waypoints(), the last lanelet is iterated through to get the point with minimum distance to goal point.
All points after that point are removed from the lanelet, so last point of the lanelet is the one closest to goal point.
