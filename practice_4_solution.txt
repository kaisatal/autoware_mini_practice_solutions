lanelet2_global_planner.py:

Goal point reached:
    When the car is close enough to the goal point, an empty list of waypoints is published once.
Matching the path end and goal point:
    In convert_lanelets_to_waypoints(), the last lanelet is iterated through to get the point with minimum distance to goal point.
    All points after that point are removed from the lanelet, so last point of the lanelet is the one closest to goal point.

pure_pursuit_follower.py:

Goal point reached:
    When an empty list of waypoints is received, then:
    - In path_callback(), self.path_linestring is set to None
    - In current_pose_callback(), if self.path_linestring is None then vehicle_cmd publishes zero for steering_angle and linear_velocity.
